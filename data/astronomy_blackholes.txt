A black hole is one of the most enigmatic objects in the universe. It is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles, no light, not even electromagnetic radiation—can escape from it. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts as an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.

The theory of general relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, provided the first theoretical framework for black holes. The theory predicted that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The point at which all the mass is concentrated is called a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume, where the known laws of physics break down.

There are several types of black holes. Stellar black holes are the most common. They are formed when a very massive star, typically more than 20 times the mass of our sun, exhausts its nuclear fuel. The core of the star collapses under its own gravity, leading to a massive explosion known as a supernova. While the outer layers of the star are blown into space, the core implodes, crushing itself into a single point—a singularity—and a black hole is born.

Supermassive black holes, on the other hand, are giants, with masses millions to billions of times greater than our sun. These behemoths are found at the center of most large galaxies, including our own Milky Way. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced "A-star") and has a mass of about 4 million solar masses. The origin of supermassive black holes is still a topic of active research, but it is believed they began forming early in the universe's history and grew over billions of years by accreting (pulling in) gas, dust, and even other stars.
