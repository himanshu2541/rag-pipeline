Existentialism is a school of philosophy that emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, primarily associated with thinkers such as Søren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus. At its heart, existentialism is concerned with the human condition, focusing on the individual's experience of freedom, responsibility, and the search for meaning in a world that is often seen as indifferent or meaningless.

A central tenet of existentialism, famously articulated by Jean-Paul Sartre, is "existence precedes essence." This is the idea that individuals are not born with a predefined purpose, nature, or "essence" given to them by a god or by nature. Instead, a person is "born into" existence first. It is then up to that individual to create their own essence—their values, purpose, and identity—through their choices and actions. We are, as Sartre put it, "condemned to be free."

This total freedom comes with a profound sense of responsibility. Because there is no pre-ordained plan or external moral code, the individual is solely responsible for every choice they make. This burden of freedom can lead to feelings of "angst" or "dread," a deep-seated anxiety about the weight of our own choices and the apparent meaninglessness of our existence.

Albert Camus, often associated with existentialism, developed a related concept called absurdism. Camus believed that the central conflict of human life is the "absurd": the human tendency to seek inherent meaning and value in life, clashing with the "unreasonable silence" of the universe, which offers none. In his essay "The Myth of Sisyphus," Camus compares the human condition to the Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was condemned for eternity to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down.

Camus's solution to the absurd is not to despair or escape, but to embrace the conflict itself. He argues that one must acknowledge the absurdity of existence and then rebel against it by living life passionately and freely. The struggle itself is what gives life its value. Camus concludes his essay with the famous line: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."
