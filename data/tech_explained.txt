Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is an advanced technique in artificial intelligence that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). At its core, an LLM is a massive neural network trained on a vast dataset of text and code. This training allows it to understand and generate human-like text, answer questions, translate languages, and perform various other language tasks. However, a standard LLM's knowledge is static; it is frozen at the point in time when its training data was collected. This means it cannot access real-time information, is unaware of private or domain-specific data, and can sometimes "hallucinate" or invent facts.

RAG directly addresses these critical limitations. The "Retrieval" part of RAG involves connecting the LLM to an external knowledge base, such as a vector database. This database is first loaded with specific documents, like company reports, medical journals, or any private data. When a user asks the LLM a question, the RAG system first retrieves relevant snippets of information from this database.

The "Augmented" part comes next. The system takes these retrieved snippets and inserts them directly into the prompt it sends to the LLM, effectively providing it with a "cheat sheet" or "open-book" for the question. The prompt becomes something like: "Based *only* on the following context, answer the user's question. Context: [retrieved text snippets]. Question: [user's original question]."

This process fundamentally changes how the LLM operates. Instead of relying solely on its frozen, internal knowledge, it can now synthesize answers based on real-time, relevant, and verifiable information. The benefits are enormous: it reduces hallucinations by grounding the model in factual data, allows the model to access private information it was never trained on, and provides users with up-to-date answers. This makes RAG one of the most practical and powerful applications of LLMs in real-world business and research scenarios.

The mechanism behind the retrieval is itself a key piece of technology. It relies on "embeddings," which are numerical representations of text. An embedding model, like the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` you are using, converts text documents into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors are stored in a vector store, like FAISS. When a user sends a query, their query is also converted into a vector. The store then performs a similarity search to find the "closest" document vectors to the query vector, which is how it finds the most relevant chunks of text.
