Economics is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on the behavior of individual agents, such as households, firms, and consumers, and how their decisions interact in specific markets. Macroeconomics, in contrast, looks at the economy as a whole, studying aggregate phenomena such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.

A foundational concept in microeconomics is the law of supply and demand. This principle describes the relationship between the quantity of a product that producers are willing to sell at various prices (supply) and the quantity that consumers are willing to buy at various prices (demand). When the price of a product rises, producers are typically willing to supply more of it, while consumers will demand less. Conversely, when the price falls, producers supply less, and consumers demand more.

The "equilibrium price" is the point at which the supply and demand curves intersect. At this price, the quantity supplied by producers is equal to the quantity demanded by consumers, resulting in a stable market. If the price is set too high, a surplus will occur (more supply than demand), forcing prices down. If the price is set too low, a shortage will occur (more demand than supply), driving prices up.

In macroeconomics, a key concept is inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services in an economy is rising, and consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the United States, attempt to manage inflation to maintain economic stability. The primary tool they use is adjusting interest rates. When inflation is too high, the central bank will raise interest rates. This makes borrowing more expensive, which slows down economic activity, reduces spending, and typically cools down inflation. This is known as "demand-pull" inflation. "Cost-push" inflation, another type, occurs when the costs of production (like raw materials or wages) increase, forcing companies to raise their prices.
