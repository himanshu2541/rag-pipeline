Photosynthesis is the fundamental biological process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This process is essential for nearly all life on Earth, as it produces the oxygen we breathe and the food that forms the basis of most food chains. The chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose, a type of sugar, which the plant uses as fuel for its growth and other metabolic activities.

The reaction for photosynthesis is typically summarized as:
6CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) + 6H2O (Water) + Light Energy → C6H12O6 (Glucose) + 6O2 (Oxygen)

This process primarily occurs in specialized organelles within plant cells called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for the green color of leaves and is the key molecule that absorbs sunlight. The process is divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs light energy to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct and creating energy-carrying molecules (ATP and NADPH). In the Calvin cycle, these energy molecules are used to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into glucose.

On the other side of the energy equation is cellular respiration. While photosynthesis *creates* food (glucose), cellular respiration is the process by which cells *break down* that glucose to release its stored energy. This energy is then captured in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which acts as the main energy currency for the cell, powering all its activities.

Cellular respiration occurs in both plants and animals. In eukaryotic cells (like those of humans and plants), the most efficient form of this process takes place in another organelle called the mitochondrion, often nicknamed the "powerhouse of the cell." Aerobic respiration, which requires oxygen, is the most efficient method and involves multiple steps, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. It is the complementary process to photosynthesis, as it consumes oxygen and glucose to produce carbon dioxide, water, and ATP.
